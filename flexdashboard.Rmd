> Key Findings

* Global 

  * There was a slow and steady increase in literacy rate for adult aged 15 and above and youth aged 15-24 globally over the years.

* Regional

  * There was a significant increase in the literacy rate in adult aged 15 and above in Middle East & North Africa, South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.
  * South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa also had improved the literacy rate tremendously in the youth age group over the years.
  * Both East Asia & Pacific and Latin America & Caribbean had an 5% increase in literacy rate in the adult group where as the literacy rate increase approximately 4% in the youth group in Latin America & Caribbean and a small increase in the youth group in East Asia & Pacific. 
  * Central Europe and the Baltics and Europe & Central Asia had maintained a high literacy rate in both age groups over the years..

* Different income levels
  
  * Both adult and youth groups that have higher income tend to have higher a level of literacy skills.

> Key Findings

* From the map

  * The average government spending on education across countries ranged between 1.2% - 11.5% of their GDP.

* By income group

  * What evident on the graph is that the low income countries are devoted much lesser proportion of their GDP but also we can see that spending has increased on average for those countries. 
  * On the other hand, high income countries spending more share of their GDP roughly between 4.5% to 5%.
  * However the data had many missing values, a broad upward trend can be observed.

* By region
  
  * During the time period, South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa had the lowest spending ranging between 3-4% but again, the plot shows upward trend for those regions. 
  * For the other regions, it has been relatively stable over time.

* From table
  * The increase in education spending is evident for the majority of countries. 
  * But it remained at same level for upper middle income countries.

* Conclusion
  * Overall, it can be concluded that the total amount of global resources spent on education is increasing over the world.

  * The percentage dropped for all these three regions from 2000 to 2019

* From the bar plot

  * More females in primary school age are out of school compare with males in Middle East & North Africa, South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa

* From the table
  
  * The difference in percentage is the highest in South Asia in 2000, but it dropped significantly in the two decades
  * Same trend can be observed in Middle East & North Africa
  * Percentage of male primary-school-aged children who are out of school is slightly higher than female in Europe & Central Asia and Latin America & Caribbean in 2019

> Key Findings

* From the first graph (Pupil-teacher ratio(%) between 2000-2019)

  * Pupil-teacher ratio seems similar across 2000-2018
  * In 2019, there's a significant decrease in pupil-teacher ratio especially in tertiary level and primary level. Next, there's an increase pupil-teacher ratio in upper secondary level, secondary level and lower secondary level. 

* From the tables (Highest/Lowest Average Pupil-teacher ratio)

  * Holding other variable constant, the highest average ratio is 24.74901 in Sub-saharan Africa's primary level between 2000-2019
  * Holding other variable constant, the lowest average ratio is 7.883399 in North America's lower-secondary level between 2000-2019

* From the second graph (Average pupil-teacher ratio on different income group in each region)
  
  * Interestingly, it seems that Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Middle East & North Africa has greater proportion in low income group comparing to other countries. 
  * Middle East & North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa has greater average pupil-teacher ratio in primary level. 
  * Europe& Central Asia has similar average pupil-teacher ratio across region.
  * East Asia & Pacific and Latin America & Caribbean has similar average pupil-teacher ratio.
